## Features

### Title and logo

I have used a very simple logo that shows the 4 operators (+, -, *, /)that are used in the quiz and a simple heading of 'Maths Quiz'.

### Introduction page

The first screen the user sees is the introduction modal. This very simple asks the user 'How many questions can you answer in 30 seconds?'.  There is a button to press to start the quiz.  Again very simple and easy for the user.  I have added that the button color goes from pale blue to dark blue when the user hovers over the button.  I have used a red backgorund and black text so that it is bold and easy to read.

### Manual Testing
- I tested you cannot enter anything else but a number.
- 
- I tested all the above on the development site and the fully deployed site.
- I tested that my website worked on different browsers - Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox.
- I tested that my website is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools.
- I have also manually tested on a number of different devices - android phone, iphone, ipad, mini ipad.

### Bugs and fixes

When a user had put a number in the answer box but had not hit enter or submit button the answer box was not being cleared so when the next game began there was a number already in the answer box.  I added code to clear the answer box at the beginning of each game.
